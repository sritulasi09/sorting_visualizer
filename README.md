# Sorting Visualizer

Welcome to the Sorting Visualizer! This is a web-based application that allows you to visualize various sorting algorithms in action, providing an interactive and educational experience. See how different sorting algorithms rearrange elements in real-time.


### Features

- ##### Sorting Algorithms: The Sorting Visualizer supports the following algorithms:
  
  - Bubble Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Insertion Sort
    
- Array Generation: Generate an array of random numbers for visualization. Adjust the size of the array to see how different algorithms perform on different input sizes.
- Visualization: Visualize the sorting process using bars, where the height of each bar represents the value of the corresponding element in the array.
- Customization: Adjust the sorting speed and observe how each algorithm behaves under different conditions.
  

#### To get started with the Sorting Visualizer, follow these steps:

1. Open the `sort.html` file in web browser.

3. Adjust the array size and sorting speed using the provided controls.

4. Click on the sorting algorithm buttons to visualize the sorting process.


#### The Sorting Visualizer is built using the following technologies:

- HTML: Markup language for structuring the web page.
- CSS: Stylesheet language for styling the visual components.
- JavaScript: Programming language for implementing the sorting algorithms and interactive functionality.
